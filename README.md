# ShareSpace

ShareSpace is a personal project developed by @telishreyas10. The project allows users to create, delete, and search for pins, which are images representing various catergories,interests, inspirations, or ideas. It is developed using React in the frontend, Sanity for the backend, and utilizes Google OAuth for authentication.


## Technologies Used

**React:** The frontend of the application is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allows for efficient and reusable code, making it ideal for creating a responsive and interactive user interface.

**Sanity:**  Sanity serves as the backend for the project. It is a headless CMS (Content Management System) that provides a flexible and customizable data structure for managing pins, users, and other relevant data. It allows for easy content creation, organization, and retrieval through its intuitive API.


**Google OAUTH:** The project leverages Google OAuth for user authentication. By integrating Google OAuth, users can securely log in to the application using their Google accounts, eliminating the need for creating a separate account and ensuring user data privacy.

**Tailwind:** Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework designed to enable users to create applications faster and easier.
